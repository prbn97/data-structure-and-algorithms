## Big O notation

Well, big O is a way to mathematically figure out , which code runs more efficiently.

Understanding this will also make you a better coder.  one example:

We have two sets of code.

both of these are going to accomplish the same thing but they're written differently.
How do we determine which one is better.

### Time complexity

1. code one runs for 15 seconds.

2. code two runs a lot longer than 15 seconds.

We want our code to run as quickly as possible, be as efficient as possible. So by this measure, code one is the better code.

This is what is called time complexity. But we don't measure time complexity in time.

We measure it in the number of operations. 
Because if you took the same code and we ran it on a faster computer, it would complete in less time, but the number of operations would be the same

### Space complexity

space complexity is the amount of memory that something uses.
[for later]

### Worst case

when you're dealing with this kind of notation, there are three Greek letters that you'll consistently see.

*They are omega, theta and Omicron*

Omicron is better known as O, aka big O, and big O is the one that you're going to see most often.

 - the best case is represented with the Greek letter _Omega_.

 - the average case is represented with the Greek letter _Theta_.

 - the worst case is represented with the Greek letter _Omicron_.
